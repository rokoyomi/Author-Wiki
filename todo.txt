-- NOW --
make all forms post to current page instead of directly to insert/update/delete
make remove buttons work

-- NEXT --
link organization to location (base location)
link organization to character (leader)
signup page
trigger fr user statistics
trigger for parent location deletion

-- LATER --
deletes should set default (mostly)

-- WAY LATER --
optionally remove story_id from the arc links
add category attributes to most entities
add descriptions to bridge tables
improve ui

-- CODEBASE IMPROVEMENT IDEAS --
don't pass in user and table name to every template
remove unnecessary parameters from query function
beter table names

-- QUERY/SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS --
only select variables that are needed
don't show characters already assigned to arc
don't show locations assigned to worlds
don't show locations that have parent locations in worlds
world and story as the central entitie after author, you addother entities to them

-- WEIRD BEHAVIOURS--
-- SAFE -- 
if a user tries to add an element on another's profile, it adds it to their own profile instead
-- UNSAFE --
